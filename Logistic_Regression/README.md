# Project Title: E-commerce Product Analysis

## Overview

This project involves using Logistic Regression for E-commerce Product Analysis. Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, where the outcome is a categorical variable with two classes. In our case, we have explored two prediction tasks:

1. **Discount Level Prediction:** Predicting whether a product has a high or low discount based on features like product rating.

2. **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the sentiment (positive or negative) of user reviews for a product based on features like product rating and review content.

## What is Logistic Regression?

Logistic Regression is a type of regression analysis used for predicting the probability of an event occurring. It is commonly employed for binary classification tasks, such as spam detection, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis.

## Why Logistic Regression?

- **Simplicity:** Logistic Regression is simple yet effective, making it a good starting point for classification tasks.
  
- **Interpretability:** The model provides interpretable results, allowing us to understand the impact of each feature on the predicted outcome.

- **Well-suited for Binary Classification:** Logistic Regression is specifically designed for binary outcomes, making it appropriate for tasks with two possible classes.

## Steps Undertaken

### 1. Data Exploration

- We started with a dataset containing information about products, including product IDs, ratings, discounted prices, and review details.

### 2. Problem Formulation

- Identified two prediction tasks: Discount Level Prediction and Sentiment Analysis.

### 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

### 4. Model Training

#### Discount Level Prediction

- Trained a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a product has a high or low discount.

#### Sentiment Analysis

- Trained a Logistic Regression model to predict the sentiment of user reviews.
