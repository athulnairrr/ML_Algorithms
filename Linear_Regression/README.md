# Linear Regression Overview

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship, where changes in the independent variables correspond to a linear change in the dependent variable.

## What is it Used For?

Linear Regression is primarily employed for predicting the value of a continuous dependent variable based on the values of one or more independent variables. It finds applications in various fields for tasks such as:

1. **Prediction:** Forecasting future values based on historical data.
2. **Trend Analysis:** Identifying trends and patterns in datasets.
3. **Correlation Analysis:** Assessing the strength of relationships between variables.

## Why Learn Linear Regression?

- **Simplicity:** Linear Regression is a straightforward and interpretable method, making it a suitable starting point for predictive modeling.

- **Versatility:** Applicable in a wide range of domains, from finance and economics to biology and social sciences.

- **Foundation for Advanced Models:** Understanding Linear Regression provides a solid foundation for more complex machine learning algorithms.

## Key Concepts in Linear Regression:

- **Coefficients:** Represent the weights assigned to each independent variable in predicting the dependent variable.

- **Intercept:** Represents the predicted value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are set to zero.

- **Residuals:** Differences between the actual and predicted values, used to assess the model's performance.
