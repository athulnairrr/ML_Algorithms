# Steps taken into consideration when making this Project

1.**Linear Regression Project:**
Started with a discussion on a linear regression project.
Chose to work on second-hand car prices.

2.**Dataset Selection:**
Shared a dataset with columns like on road old, on road now, years, etc.

3.**Data Preprocessing:**
Unzipped and loaded the dataset.
Explored preprocessing steps for the chosen dataset.

4.**Code for Dataset Preprocessing:**
Shared code for unzipping in Google Colab.
Discussed preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and normalization.

5.**Linear Regression Modeling:**
Chose linear regression for the second-hand car prices project.

6.**Evaluation Metrics:**
Discussed and implemented evaluation metrics like MSE, MAE, RMSE, R-squared.

7.**Visualization:**
Proposed visualizations post-evaluation, such as predicted vs. actual plots and feature importance.

8.**Model Overview:**
Summarized the linear regression model steps, including feature engineering, regularization, and evaluation.

9.**Conclusion:**
Emphasized the need for careful interpretation and potential next steps.
